<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick guide for New Starters -->

## Welcome to the Protech team. This list will get you started... 

* We use Google Apps for documents and email, you should have received your login details from IT support. If you haven’t ask your manager.  Setup your account. Other Mumsnetters use gmail chat so we recommend you keep Gmail open in a browser. 

* In Protech we use Slack for daily messaging, IT support should have sent you an invite. If you haven’t received it ask them to send again. Setup your account. Make sure you have joined the following channels: #protech-announcements, #protech-random, #protech-standups. Ask your line manager if there’s any other channels you should join. 

* We use Trello to manage our weekly tasks, you should have been sent an invite. If you haven’t received it ask your manager. Setup your account and ask your manager to show you how to use it. 

* We store all our documents in the ‘Development’ folder on G-Drive, you should have access to this, if you don’t ask your manager. We recommend you ‘Add to my Drive’ (right click) as you will need it often. 

* We document everything on this Wiki - you should look here first if you're trying to find some documentation.
