The wiki is the primary source of information in protech. Everyone should contribute to the wiki but we need to follow some simple rules to keep it organised.

## Creating pages

* Pages should always be created under a topic (eg Rails, Front End, KIT).
* Do not create pages at the top level of the wiki.
* Do not create pages that are children of other pages.
* When you have created a page, add a link to under the correct topic on the homepage

## Requesting new topics

* Do not create new topics (eg, Rails, Front End, KIT).
* If you require a new topic, discuss this with Jason and he will create the topic and the page.

## Questions

Jason will act as the editor, if you have any questions about the wiki please just ask.
