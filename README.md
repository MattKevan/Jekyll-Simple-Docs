# Jekyll Simple Docs

A simple starter site for documentation, using Bootstrap 4. It's based on the Bootstrap site, but simplified quite significantly.

There's already lots of template Jekyll sites for documentation, but after trying most of them I couldn't find one that was both attractive looking and simple to use. So I made this one.
