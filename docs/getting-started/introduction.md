This is a starter Jekyll documentation site, adapted from the Bootstrap 4 documentation.

## Why this project?

There's lots of Jekyll documentation sites, but none that had the combination of simplicity and ease of use I was looking for. Your experience may differ. 

## Getting started

Clone the repo, run ```bundle install```, then ```bundle exec jekyll serve```
