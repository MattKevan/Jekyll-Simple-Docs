This page shows all the blocks that can be used on KIT pages. 

## Using this page 
The content team should use this page to choose what blocks to use on pages.

The product team should use this page when designing new pages / blocks. Where possible we should design pages with the blocks we currently have available. We should only introduce new blocks where absolutely necessary.

The tech team should keep this page up-to-date. When product provide new pages for building in KIT, the pages should be assessed against the blocks on this page and any new blocks that need to be built should have their designs added to this page. 

## General blocks

General blocks are for use on any template and should be used in the main content area. 
They should not be used in the sidebar unless otherwise stated.
